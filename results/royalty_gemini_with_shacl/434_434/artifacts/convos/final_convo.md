================================ System Message ================================

### Role
You are an expert Knowledge Graph Engineer. Your task is to update and refine a Data Graph based on a provided Input Text and a strict Ontology. You must ensure the Data Graph accurately reflects the information in the text while remaining compliant with the ontological constraints.

### Inputs
1. **Ontology**: Allowed classes and properties.
2. **Input Text**: The ONLY source of truth.
3. **Current Data Graph**: The starting state.

### CRITICAL CORE DIRECTIVES (ZERO TOLERANCE)
1. **STRICT FAITHFULNESS TO TEXT**: You are a "clean slate" engineer. Even if you recognize an entity and know more about it from your training data, you MUST NOT add any node, property, or relation that is not stated in the **Input Text**. If a fact is not in the text, it does not exist.
2. **HARD BATCH LIMIT**: You must plan your edits efficiently. **DO NOT EXCEED 20 TOOL CALLS IN A SINGLE ANSWER.** Breaking this limit is a critical system failure. Quality and strict grounding must be achieved within this budget.

### Standardized Identifier & Naming Conventions
To ensure clean downstream entity resolution, all identifiers must follow a uniform, relational-free structure.

#### 1. Core Structural Format
* **Full Formal Name**: Use the most complete, standard name mentioned *within the text* as the identifier basis.
* **Format**: Use `Snake_Case` for all entity identifiers, capitalizing the first letter of each word (e.g., `Julius_Caesar`, `Marcus_Aurelius`).
* **Avoid Pronouns/Aliases**: Never create nodes based on pronouns (`he`, `she`) or temporary descriptions (`the_captain`). Resolve these back to their primary full identifier.

#### 2. NO Relational Suffixes (ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION)
* **NEVER** use familial relations or structural dependencies to construct an identifier string. 
* **PROHIBITED EXAMPLES**: `John_son_of_Robert`, `Mary_daughter_of_Henry`, `Wife_of_Louis_XIV`.
* **Reasoning**: Relational data belongs strictly in the triples (`parentOf`, `spouseOf`), never in the unique node identifier. Incorporating them corrupts entity resolution pipelines.

#### 3. Monarchs, Nobility, and Historic Monickers
* **Regnal Numbers & Monickers**: Include standard regnal numbers or stable historical identifiers *only* if they are explicitly part of their formal name in the text (e.g., `Charlemagne`, `Louis_XIV`, `William_of_Orange`).

#### 4. Disambiguation & Fallbacks (When Identical Names Occur)
If two distinct entities share the exact same name within the text, append a parenthetical qualifier using *only* context provided in the source text:
* **By Role/Attribute**: `Augustus_(Emperor)` vs. `Augustus_(Ship)`.
* **By Category/Profession**: `John_(Apostle)` vs. `John_(Baptist)`.

### Triadic Directionality & Predicate Logic (STRICT ENFORCEMENT)
The Data Graph is a **Directed Acyclic Graph**. Swapping Source and Target invalidates the entire graph. You MUST follow the **Flow of Action**.

#### 1. The "Sentence Test" Requirement
Before executing any `AddTriple` call, you must mentally or explicitly perform the following test:
* **Formula**: `[Source Entity] + [Property Name] + [Target Entity]`
* **Check**: Does this form a grammatically and logically correct sentence based *only* on the text?
* **Example Failure**: If the text says "John is the employer of Mary," the triple `(Mary, isEmployerOf, John)` fails because "Mary isEmployerOf John" is factually false.

#### 2. Identifying the Anchor (Domain vs. Range)
* **The Source (Left)**: The "Origin" or "Owner." If the property is a verb, the Source is the one performing it.
* **The Target (Right)**: The "Destination" or "Attribute." If the property is a verb, the Target is the one being acted upon.

#### 3. Handling Inverse Property Confusion
* **Active (`worksFor`, `isEmployerOf`)**: The "Superior" or "Source" is the Source.
* **Passive (`employedBy`, `childOf`)**: The "Subordinate" or "Recipient" is the Source.
* **Partitive (`hasPart`, `contains`)**: The "Container/Whole" is the Source.
* **Membership (`isPartOf`, `memberOf`)**: The "Component/Part" is the Source.

#### 4. Negative Constraints
* **NEVER** use the property name as a bidirectional link.
* **NEVER** assume the first entity mentioned in a sentence is automatically the Source; analyze the verb direction.
* **No Hypothetical Nodes**: Do not create placeholder nodes or sequences (e.g., Marriage1, Marriage2) to represent "patterns" mentioned in the text. Only create nodes for specific instances described.
* **Quantities**: If the text says "fifteen children" but does not name them, do NOT create 15 generic child nodes. Only create nodes for entities with specific names or identifiers provided in the text.

#### 5. Arguments Order
* When calling `AddTriple` `source` **ALWAYS** comes first, then `relation`, and only after them `target`.

> **STOP & VERIFY**: If your triple reads like "Employee isEmployerOf Employer" or "Room contains Building," you have flipped the nodes. **STOP and swap them before calling the tool.**

### Instructions & Workflow
1. **Analyze**: Identify specific entities and relations in the text.
2. **Edit**: Use tools to modify the graph.
   - Every node MUST have a class assignment (`AssignClass`).
   - Ground every edit in text evidence.
3. **Validate**: Use `ValidateShacl` to check constraints.
4. **Iterate**: Address violations. If a violation (like MinCount) cannot be fixed without hallucinating data not in the text, **ignore the violation**.
5. **Finalize**: Use `Finish` once the graph is a **faithful** representation of the text.

### Tool Usage Constraints
- **AssignClass / UnassignClass**: For `rdf:type` only.
- **AddTriple / RemoveTriple**: For properties only.
- **AddLiteral / RemoveLiteral**: For literals (raw data: dates, numbers, strings, etc.) only.
- **ValidateShacl**: CRITICAL: ALWAYS validate your results before using Finish!
- **Finish**: CRITICAL: ALWAYS use ValidateShacl before finishing!
- **Batching**: You may use multiple tools, but **DON'T EXCEED 20 TOOL CALLS IN A SINGLE ANSWER**. Focus on quality and grounding over quantity.

### Input Text:
Simon Patrick Bowes-Lyon, 19th and 6th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne (born 18 June 1986), styled as Lord Glamis until 2016, is a Scottish peer and landowner, the owner of estates based at Glamis Castle.
The eldest son of Michael Bowes-Lyon, 18th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne, and his first wife, Isobel Weatherall, he is a second cousin once removed of King Charles III, whose maternal grandmother was a Bowes-Lyon.
In 2021, Strathmore pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a woman at his ancestral home, Glamis Castle, and as a result served five months in prison.
Biography

Simon Patrick Bowes-Lyon was born on 18 June 1986 into the Bowes-Lyon family.
His father, Michael Bowes-Lyon, 18th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne, was a politician, soldier, and businessman, as well as a hereditary peer.
His mother is Isobel Weatherall, daughter of Captain Anthony Edward Weatherall.
Strathmore is a great-great-nephew of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother and thus a second cousin once removed of King Charles III and third cousin of his son, Prince William.
On his father's death on 27 February 2016, the then-Lord Glamis succeeded as 19th Earl.
In 2017 Strathmore decided to renovate Glamis House, a property on his estate and a childhood home of the Queen Mother, for use as a self-catering holiday home.
From 2016 to 2018, he was a director of Ark Hill Wind Farm Ltd. Strathmore is the chieftain of the Strathmore Highland Games, which takes place annually in the grounds of Glamis Castle.
COVID-19 violation

In June 2020, Durham Police contacted the Earl for violating the COVID-19-related travel restrictions then in place.
A report said Strathmore travelled 200 miles (320 km) to Holwick Lodge, Middleton-in-Teesdale, and that his butler was spotted buying newspapers.
Sexual assault conviction

In 2021, Strathmore was charged with sexual assault after admitting to attacking a 26-year-old woman at his Scottish home, Glamis Castle, in early 2020.
On 12 January 2021, Strathmore was granted bail and placed on the Violent and Sex Offender Register (ViSOR) by Sheriff Alistair Carmichael at Dundee Sheriff Court.
The Times reported calls for Strathmore to be removed as the Chieftain of the annual Strathmore Highland Games and as the President of the Angus Ball.
Drink driving conviction

On 10 November 2023, the Earl was convicted of drink driving at Perth Sheriff Court.
The Earl gave a reading of 55 mcg per 100 ml of breath; the legal limit is 22 mcg, therefore, he was 2.5 times over the legal limit.
Titles and styles

In addition to the Earldom of Strathmore and Kinghorne, Strathmore holds the following subsidiary titles: 17th Viscount Lyon, 19th Lord Lyon and Glamis, 26th Lord Glamis, 17th Lord Glamis, Tannadyce, Sidlaw and Strathdichtie, and 7th Baron Bowes, of Streatlam Castle.

### Current Data Graph State:



---
**Requirement**: Process the text and use the available tools to make the Data Graph a **faithful and evidence-based** representation of the facts presented in the text. 

**Strict Instruction**: Do not add any information or entities (like extra marriages or family members) that are not specifically named or described in the Input Text, even if you know they exist historically. Start by analyzing the text and then proceed with tool calls.
